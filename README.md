YTM+ for YouTube Music is a Chrome extension designed to make YouTube Music a more enjoyable experience. The extension was originally built as just a mini player in the browser, but has grown to include features like lyrics, themes, notification, and other integrations with LastFM and Spotify.

## Features
### Mini Player
The mini player allows you to control YTM from anywhere in the browser. This includes playback and audio controls, as well as being able to see and select from your queue.

### Lyrics
YouTube Music now has built-in lyrics, but they are often pretty limited. YTM+ uses Audd.io's API to fetch additional lyrics that YTM may not natively have and display them in the mini player.

### Themes
YTM+ allows you to build themes for both the mini player and the YouTube Music interface with simple controls.

### Spotify to YTM
It's annoying when your friends who use Spotify send you Spotify tracks to listen to as a user of YTM. This feature displays a popup on Spotify track pages, and with a click of a button, you will be redirected to the YTM track. (Note: YTM does not have a public API, so this feature has some limitations and does not work perfectly)

### Notifications, LastFM, and keyboard controls
YTM+ will display push notifications when the next track plays, allowing the user to quickly see what is now playing. Additionally, users can optionally connect their LastFM accounts and YTM+ will scrobble their tracks automatically. And finally, YTM+ adds some basic controls to the YTM webpage that allows for controlling playback with the keyboard.
